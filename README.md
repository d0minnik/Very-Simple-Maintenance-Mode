# Maintenance Mode Plugin

A  very simple WordPress plugin to enable and customize a "Maintenance Mode" for your site. With this plugin, you can easily display a custom message, title, and style when your site is under construction or maintenance.

## Features

- **Enable/Disable Maintenance Mode**: Turn the maintenance mode on or off directly from the WordPress admin panel.
- **Customizable Title and Message**: Set a custom title and message to inform visitors about the maintenance.
- **Custom Styles**: Add custom CSS styles to modify the appearance of the maintenance page.
- **Admin Access**: Only non-administrators will see the maintenance message; admins can still access the site normally.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin files or clone this repository to your WordPress `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Go to your WordPress admin panel.
3. Navigate to **Plugins > Installed Plugins** and activate the **Maintenance Mode** plugin.
4. Once activated, go to **Settings > Maintenance Mode** to configure the plugin settings.
   - Enable maintenance mode.
   - Customize the title, message, and styles for the maintenance page.

## Usage

Once maintenance mode is enabled, visitors (except administrators) will see the custom maintenance message and styling you configured. Admins can continue browsing the site normally.

To disable maintenance mode, simply uncheck the "Enable Maintenance Mode" option in the plugin settings.

## Customization

- **Title**: Set a custom title for the maintenance page.
- **Message**: Customize the message displayed to visitors.
- **Styles**: Use CSS to style the maintenance page (e.g., background color, font styles).
